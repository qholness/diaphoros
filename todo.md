# To Do.

For all data, assume the year 2000 is benchmark.  Take median otherwise.

1. Create randomizer for UN recognized countries.

2. Get data for the following properties in US states for years 1990 - current:
	* Disease (emailed --- portal is down).
	* Crime. (https://data.unodc.org/#state:1)
		* In progress, there's a ton of these though.

3. Create parser to parse country names into UN codes (in progress...)

4. For each of the three datasets, create probabilities (per person).

5. Store this data in sqlite database.

6. Link the database with the randomizer, create random events by year.
